This game was created as a project in the course
"Multimediaprogrammering med Python".

It is a simple take on the classic Tetris and
features the usual controls.

As the game progresses and your levels builds up
you will notice that the speed also increases.

In order to clear the board you need to create full
lines on the board. To archive as high points
as possible you need to stack up and create four
simultaneus lines, this is also called a Tetris.

It is also however fine to create single, double or
tripple lines, but this will render you less points.
